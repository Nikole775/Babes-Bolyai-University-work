This project is a command-based console application designed to manage apartment expenses efficiently. Built with a modular structure, it separates the user interface, functionality, and application logic, ensuring clarity and maintainability. The system supports adding, modifying, filtering, and undoing expense operations while handling errors gracefully.

Key Features:
Expense Management:

Add, remove, and replace expenses by apartment, type, or range.
Commands include add, remove, replace, and list.
Data Display:

Use texttable for clear tabular representation.
Filter and display expenses by type or amount with conditions (<, =, >).
Undo Functionality:

Reverse modifications step by step, ensuring data integrity.
Error Handling:

Validates inputs and handles errors without crashing.
Preloaded Data:

Starts with 10 random expenses for quick testing.
Learning Outcomes:
Modular programming with clean separation of logic and UI.
Effective use of Pythonâ€™s data structures (list, dict) and exception handling.
Implementation of undo and filtering for robust user experience.
Tabular data representation with third-party libraries.
This assignment offers hands-on experience in designing a practical and user-friendly expense management system.
