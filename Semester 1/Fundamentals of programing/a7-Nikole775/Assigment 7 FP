This project is a feature-rich, menu-driven console application designed to manage a list of students. It offers functionalities for adding, displaying, filtering, and undoing operations on a student list, all while providing flexibility in data persistence through multiple repository implementations.

The program follows clean architecture principles with classes dedicated to UI, Services, Domain Entities, and Repositories, ensuring modularity and maintainability.

Key Features:

Student Management:

Add new students with unique IDs, names, and group numbers.
Display the complete list of students in the repository.
Filter and delete students belonging to a specified group.
Undo the last operation, with support for multiple consecutive undos.
Repository Implementations:

MemoryRepository: Stores student data in memory during runtime.
TextFileRepository: Persists data in plain text files.
BinaryFileRepository: Uses Pickle for binary object serialization.
Preloaded Data:

The application initializes with 10 programmatically generated student entries, automatically saved to the selected repository type.
Unit Testing:

Comprehensive tests for non-UI functionalities to ensure correctness and reliability.
Usage: This project is ideal for those exploring object-oriented programming, repository patterns, and flexible data storage solutions. With its intuitive menu interface, the system simplifies student data management while demonstrating clean design principles.

Technical Stack:

Language: Python
Libraries: Pickle for serialization
Persistence Options: Memory, Text Files, Binary Files
